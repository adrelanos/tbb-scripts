Forked from:
https://gitweb.torproject.org/torbrowser.git
https://gitweb.torproject.org/torbrowser.git/blob/refs/heads/master:/src/RelativeLink/RelativeLink.sh

Discussion with upstream, torproject.org:
https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/5611

Supported platforms
===========

Currently only tested on Debian and Ubuntu. Should run on any Linux or *nix. No idea about *BSD.

Feature Requests
===========

Feature Requests are welcome, but I don't know if I will be able to implement them.

Patches
===========

Feel free to send patches or to take over development.

Security
===========

There are signed git tags.

Look into the original RelativeLink.sh and make a diff. The changes are minor and trivial.

Contact
===========
