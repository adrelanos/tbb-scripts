tbb-scripts
===========

Alternative startup scripts for the Tor Browser Bundle.
- For starting up Tor Browser without Tor and Vidalia.

Just read the comments in start-tor-browser on how to
use it.

Supported platforms
===========

Currently only tested on Debian and Ubuntu. Should run on any Linux or *nix. No idea about *BSD.

Feature Requests
===========

Feature Requests are welcome, but I don't know if I will be able to implement them.

Patches
===========

Feel free to send patches or to take over development.

Security
===========

There are signed git tags.

Look into the original RelativeLink.sh and make a diff. The changes are minor and trivial.
